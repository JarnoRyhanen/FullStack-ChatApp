# This app is a tutorial project by Adrian Hajdin(Youtube: JavaScript Mastery, video: https://youtu.be/MJzbJQLGehs).

This is a chat app built using Stream.io. I signed in for a free monthly trial and it will expire on february 25th, so the app will most likely not work after that date. 
Otherwise the next cheapest option would have been to pay 500â‚¬ a month to use Stream.

Note: the tutorial uses deprecated code that has now been deleted from the Stream-Chat-React api codebase, making the project practically impossible to finish. After searching for hours for solutions I could not find any. Unfortunately it means that I am not able to continue this project any further, which is a shame. To add even more insult to injury, the free trial expires on Feb 25th 2023. Edited 16.10 2.2.2023.
